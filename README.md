## Installation

Tested on Python 3.6

1. MPI and CMake (from [baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines))
    - MacOS: `brew install cmake openmpi`
    - Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cmake libopenmpi-dev python3-dev zlib1g-dev`
2. Python packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - likely has some unused packages in there as well
